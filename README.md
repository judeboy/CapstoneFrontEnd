The US Government has thousands of programs that provide financial aid and funding to both individual and businesses for a myriad of reasons. From student loans, to small business loans, agricultural programs and low-income housing assistance and even specialized programs for Veterans. The problem is that navigating the .gov sites is treacherous and rarely provides ease of access. What my app aims to do is streamline the search and application process for these programs by providing a central database to access these programs.
